                penalty, and (3) not otherwise limiting on our ability to
                recover under any legal theory or claim, including statutory

                the anti-spam statute). You further agree that repeated
                violations of the USE section will irreparably harm and entitle
                us to injunctive or equitable relief, in addition to monetary
